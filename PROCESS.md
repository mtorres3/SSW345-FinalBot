*Planned Process:* Scrum

*Kanban Board:* In "Project" tab of repo

*User Stories:* Created in Kanban board
  - /create command (Jon)
  - /startTask command (Will)
  - /finishTask command (Markell)
  - /showTask command (Joe)
  - /showSchedule command (Will)

**[Iteration 1: 4/10 - 4/17]**

  *Completed:* /create

  *Incomplete:* /startTask, /finishTask, /showTask, /showSchedule
  
  *Process Reflection:* Using the Scrum process has helped us sort out what tasks needed to be completed, what work was going to be assigned to each team member, and given us a good timeframe on when the user stories should be completed by.
  
  **[Iteration 2: 4/18 - 4/25]**

  *Completed:* /join, /leave, /create, /alarm, /pause, /stop, /ping (for testing purposes), /startTask, /finishTask, /showTask, /showSchedule
  
  *Incomplete:* None

  *Process Reflection:* The Kanban board and Scrum development process really benefited us because it allowed for each member of the team to focus on one task at a time within a reasonable iteration timeframe. Dividing up the work by user stories allowed everyone to evenly contribute to the project and allowed for the team to pair program when any of the other team members was faced with a roadblock.
