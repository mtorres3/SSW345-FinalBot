# SSW345 Final Report

## Problem

  Throughout our experience here at Stevens, we have definitely learned one thing: That time management is difficult. Whether it be trying to alot a good amount of time to complete a homework assignment or a final project, staying focused and productive isn't as easy as it may seem. To tackle this problem, our team has developed a Focus Bot for discord servers. With our bot, staying on task while still maintaining your productivity levels is a breeze. The features we have implemented assure that the user will have ample time to rest while still alotting a good chunk of time to getting a single task completed. This will keep the user focused and more likely to maintain their energy throughout the duration of their assignment.

## Features

The primary features we include in our bot are:
* Pomodoro timer to allow the user to maintain their productivity level throughout the duration of their assignment
*

## Limitations and Future Plans

### Limitations
While FocusBot has met our expectations and has proved to be an invaluable asset for our groupwork, it is limited in a few aspects.
* First, FocusBot does not yet delete tasks from the database. 
* Second, FocusBot does not convert user time to UTC. The user must get the UTC via a bot command (which does an API call). 
* Third, FocusBot is not deployed! It does not have a remote environment configured for it yet.

But wait there's more! 

### Future Plans
Gregg's A-Team plans to continue development of FocusBot. As noted earlier, this bot has proven to be useful for our own separate projects. Some of the future tasks are:
* Get FocusBot to delete tasks properly from dB
* Get FocusBot to automatically get user timezone and convert to UTC so user does not need to input UTC time
* Get FocusBot deployed on a remote environment!

Aside from fixing the limitations, Gregg's A-Team hopes to find this bot being used around many different servers so that others can get use from it just as we have!
