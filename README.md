## Instructions for Running:

1. IDE: User choice  
2. Language: Python3.X  
3. Package manager: pip (install if you don't have it already)

### Crucial Dependencies and Packages to download/install:

1. Youtube_dl: this downloads a youtube video if provided a url
2. Discord.py Voice: voice commands for discord bot, does not install by default
3. FFMpeg: this converts a video into a format that discord can understand, think of it as an audio file compiler

#### Youtube_dl  
You can use a package manager, such as pip to get this. Simply run this command to install:
> pip install youtube_dl  
> pip install --upgrade youtube-dl  
You can learn more about it [Here](https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/)    

#### Discord.py Voice  
You can use a package manager, such as pip to get this. Simply run this command to install:

#### FFMpeg 
This is more complicated to install properly. Here are the steps I took. There are many different ways to do this FYI. 
1. The link to downlod ffmpeg is [Here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
